Application Flow
================
1. index.php - Application front controller (AFC) - is the main entry point of the application.
2. AFC verifies that the config.php - Framework Configuration (FC) - file exists
   A. If the FC file doesn't exists, proceed to install/ folder. On install complete, redirect to site's home url (and step 1).
3. Load the FC file.
4. AFC Gets the request object, unpacks it and retrieves the request parameters.
5. Check that the requested page (specific-controller) exists, and load it (through its execute() method) - See controller flow below
   A. If the page doesn't exists, load the error page

   
CONTROLLER FLOW
===============
1. Request(ed) controller (e.g usersController) is loaded and instantiated by the AFC.
2. Request(ed) controller calls the parent (AppController) - Application specific base controller - constructor.
3. AppController calls BaseController - Framework Controller - constructor.
4. BaseController initializes the request object, the requested page, and sets up the directories for the current theme's pages and and templates.
   Control returns to AppController's constructor
5. AppController's consturctor performs custom initialization (if any), specified by the app developer.
   Control returns to the request(ed) controller's constructor.
6. Request(ed) controller's constructor completes, and control returns to AFC.
7. AFC calls request(ed) controller's execute() method
8. Request(ed) controller sets up the page (view) to be displayed, and calls the display() method to display the view
9. The BaseController's display method loads (and optionally parses) and displays the view
