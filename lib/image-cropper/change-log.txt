Updated image-cropper.php to auto-detect if jQuery is already present on the page.
This is to avoid conflict with the version of jQuery being used by the site.
Possible issues that may arise as a result of this update:
	plugin jquery version is 1.9.0, if site is using an unsupported version, plugin may not work properly


2. Same date as 1
Added ability to specify extra data to send along with the form for cropping using the "post_data" member
